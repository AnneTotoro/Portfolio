# Research

A selection of my work at the intersection of **urban morphology**, **microclimate performance**, and **computational design**—with a focus on how **spatial configurations and details shape human experience and environmental comfort**.

---

## Focus Areas

**Urban microclimate + morphology**
- Street canyons, shading, ventilation, thermal comfort
- Canonical geometries and sensitivity analysis (density, FAR, trees/LAI, etc.)

**Simulation + workflow design**
- Rhino/Grasshopper pipelines, preprocessing, parametric scenarios
- CFD / outdoor comfort workflows (e.g., UMCF / OpenFOAM-based tools)

**Spatial experience + architectural details**
- How transitions, joints, and “small” tectonic decisions choreograph movement and perception  
  (Carlo Scarpa as a key reference)

## Selected Projects

### 1) Grid Configuration & Microclimate
**Question**: How do differences in grid morphology affect pedestrian comfort (wind + heat)?  
**What I did**
- Built parametric urban scenarios (grid variants, height distributions, street width ratios)
- Defined a repeatable workflow for comparing performance across typologies
- Organized outputs into comparable metrics and visuals (maps + sections + summary tables)

**Methods / Tools**
- Rhino + Grasshopper, Ladybug (as needed), CFD workflows / outdoor comfort evaluation  
- Comparative scenario design (canonical geometries)

**Outputs**
- Comparative figures (temperature / wind / comfort maps)
- Process diagram + reproducible pipeline notes

### 2) Tokyo Case Study — Morphology Modeling & Simulation Preparation
**Question**: What breaks in dense, heterogeneous urban fabrics—and how do we make simulation setup robust?  
**What I did**
- Converted building footprints + heights to workable 3D geometry
- Iteratively refined geometry simplification for stability vs. fidelity
- Diagnosed mesh / resolution bottlenecks and documented fixes

**Key Challenges**
- Narrow canyons, sharp transitions, high geometric complexity → sensitive meshing + compute cost

**Outputs**
- Cleaned geometry set, meshing notes, and troubleshooting guide for future iterations

### 3) Spatial Transitions & Detail as Experience (Scarpa thread)
**Question**: How do architectural details (thresholds, joints, offsets) alter spatial reading and movement?  
**What I did**
- Built a research framework to connect detail → spatial transition → bodily experience
- Combined close-reading (text + drawings) with spatial diagramming (visibility / isovists, etc.)
- Identified repeatable “detail motifs” that structure perception

**Outputs**
- Diagram set (sequence / thresholds / viewing angles)
- Short paper / poster draft structure

## Methods Toolkit (quick list)

- **Modeling**: Rhino, Grasshopper  
- **Environmental**: Ladybug tools / microclimate workflows  
- **CFD / simulation**: OpenFOAM-based pipelines (as applicable), mesh iteration mindset  
- **Analysis**: scenario comparison, metric definition, visualization consistency  
- **Documentation**: reproducible notes + “how-to” pages for future reuse

## What I’m exploring next

- Sensitivity analysis of vegetation parameters (LAI, height, type) on thermal comfort  
- Visibility graph / raycasting approaches as alternatives to heavier space syntax tools  
- Bridging environmental performance metrics with **narrative of movement** (sequence + comfort)
